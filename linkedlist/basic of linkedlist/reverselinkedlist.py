# Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.

 

# Example 1:


# Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
# Output: [5,4,3,2,1]
# Example 2:


# Input: head = [1,2]
# Output: [2,1]
# Example 3:

# Input: head = []
# Output: []
 

# Constraints:

# The number of nodes in the list is the range [0, 5000].
# -5000 <= Node.val <= 5000
 

# Follow up: A linked list can be reversed either iteratively or recursively. Could you implement both?




# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def reverseList(self, head):
        a=None
        temp=head
        h=head
        

        while temp:
            next_node=temp.next
            temp.next=a
            a=temp
            temp=next_node
            
        
        return a
