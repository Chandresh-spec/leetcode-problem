# What is Cyclic Sort?

# Cyclic sort is a special sorting technique used when:

# The array contains numbers in a known range â†’ usually 1..n or 0..n.

# We want to rearrange elements to their correct position without using extra space.

# ðŸ‘‰ Idea:

# If a number is not at its correct index, swap it with the number that is currently at its target index.

# Keep doing this until every number is at the correct index
