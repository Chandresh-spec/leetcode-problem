# 🥞 Stack (Data Structure) – Brief Explanation

# A Stack is a linear data structure that follows the rule:

# ➡️ LIFO – Last In, First Out

# The item that goes in last comes out first.

# Just like:

# A stack of plates

# A stack of books

# ✅ Main Operations
# 1) push(x)

# Add (insert) an element to the top of the stack.

# 2) pop()

# Remove the top element from the stack.

# 3) peek() / top()

# See which element is at the top without removing it.

# 4) isEmpty()

# Check if the stack is empty.

# 🧠 When is Stack used?

# Stacks are used in many real-life and computer problems:

# Undo/Redo operations

# Back button in browsers

# Expression evaluation

# Checking balanced brackets ()[]{}

# Function call stack (recursion)

# DFS (Depth-First Search)

# 📌 Example

# If you push elements:
# push(10), push(20), push(30)

# Stack becomes:

# Top → [30, 20, 10] → Bottom

# pop() → removes 30

# ⏱️ Time Complexity
# Operation	Time
# push	O(1)
# pop	O(1)
# peek	O(1)
