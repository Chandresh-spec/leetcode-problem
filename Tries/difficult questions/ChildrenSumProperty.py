# Children Sum Property in Binary Tree


# 0

# 100
# Given the root of a binary tree, return true if and only if every nodeâ€™s value is equal to the sum of the values stored in its left and right children.

# For any missing ( null ) child, its value is treated as 0.
# A leaf node automatically satisfies the rule because both children are null.

# Examples:
# Input: root = [1,4,3,5]

# Output: false

# Explanation:

# The root is 1, but its children sum to 4 + 3 = 7. Since 1 â‰  7, the tree violates the property.
# Input: root = [10,4,6,1,3,2,4]

# Output: true

# Explanation:

# 4 = 1 + 3
# 6 = 2 + 4
# 10 = 4 + 6
# All internal nodes satisfy the condition.
# Input: root = [35,20,15,15,5,10,5]

# true
# false
